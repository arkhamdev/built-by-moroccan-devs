## Submissions
We only accept submissions from Moroccans, people who's primary hot beverage is mint tea, and we only select high quality and beautiful examples of projects, web apps, desktop or mobile, built by Moroccans. All submissions must follow the instructions on the _How to submit_ section below.

## How to submit
To submit a site suggestion, [open an issue](https://github.com/arkhamdev/built-by-moroccan-devs/issues/new) or create a pull request. Make sure the screenshot is 1000x800 and please double check that everything looks good before submitting. It's also a good idea to run the screenshot through an image optimizer like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) before including it. This will help keep the website fast and the repository small as possible.

## About the site
Inspired by [Built With Ember](http://builtwithember.io/). It's built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), developed on GitHub, and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
